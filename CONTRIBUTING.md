# tslide is an [OPEN Open Source Project][openopensource]

-----------------------------------------

## What?

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

## Changes to this arrangement

This document may also be subject to updates from the [original manifesto][manifesto], seperate pull-requests or changes by contributors where they believe they have something valuable to add or change.
